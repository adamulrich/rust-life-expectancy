# Rust Life Expectancy Dataset Query Engine

This program walks a user through generating a query against a per region per year life expectancy data set. It provides options for filtering, sorting and calculating.

I had previously done this in python, so this was a port to rust. The intent was to learn rust syntax and concepts such as block scope, ownership borrowing, etc.
